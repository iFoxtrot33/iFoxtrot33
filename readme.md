## Hi there!üëã

I'm Iurii, Junior Frontend Developer üë®üèª‚Äçüíª, curently looking for a job. (Remote or based in Georgia)

## About me

In the past, I worked as a merchant marine officer, until I was invited to join a startup. 
The startup unfortunately failed, but I decided from that moment to pursue a career in tech. 
At the moment, I am in the final stage of my education at Hexlet Coding School and I am happy to hear from you.
